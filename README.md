ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcelklehr

I'm a university student working on Open Source projects that further freedom and privacy and allow people to use the fruits of technology with sovereignty. This is my small contribution to a world where people are not dependent on big corporations to live a life eased by technology.
