ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcelklehr

I'm a university student working on Open Source projects that further 

freedom and privacy and allow people to use the fruits of technology 

with sovereignty. That means: transparently, securely, privately and 

independently from large corporations. Currently, my main work is on 

floccus, a browser extension for syncing bookmarks, and the nextcloud 

bookmarks app, which allows you to collect, organize and share your 

favorite places on the web.

This is my small contribution to a world where people are not dependent

on big corporations to live a life eased by technology.
